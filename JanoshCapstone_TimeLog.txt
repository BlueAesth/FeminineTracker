6:50 Finish (Total 3hrs20mins)

Creating Login Logic
	Not working.
3:30pm Finish (Total 1.5hrs)

Switched/started new project. 
	Implemented pop-up and calendar.
12:00pm Finish (Total 2hrs)

Continuing implementation/integration of login pop-up and calandar main scene.

Simplified code and worked on the css too.
4:00pm Finish (Total 5hrs //-1hr lunch)
/*This was when I decided that I had to let go of making a cooking/recipe feature for the application. I didn't realise that making the calandar was going to take that long, but there were a lot of things to consider with calandar logic that I overestimated. Nevermind that it took so long to get "up and running" with just starting and setting up the tools I needed foe the application.*/

/*The message of the day (m.o.d) took a bit to figure out but once it was done I was relieved. I was happy to be able to add one "extra" feature that I had wanted into the application since I had to cut a few of the other, bigger features later on.*/
